  # There are two things you should know about log levels/severity:
  #  - syslog defines levels from 0 (Emergency) to 7 (Debug).
  #    0 (Emergency) and 1 (Alert) levels are reserved for OS kernel.
  #  - Ruby default Logger defines levels from 0 (DEBUG) to 4 (FATAL) and 5 (UNKNOWN).
  #    Note that order is inverted.
  # For compatibility we define our constants as Ruby Logger, and convert values before
  # generating GELF message, using defined mapping.
